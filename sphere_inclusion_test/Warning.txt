Warning:
The two examples of 3D inclusion tests included in this folder ONLY work for the deal.ii version 9.5.0 or older.
For the newer deal.ii (for example, the developed branch), somehow, the merge_triangulation function could no longer merge different parts of the mesh correctly. See the following code:
    GridGenerator::merge_triangulations({&tria_inner, &tria_outer,
                                         &cube1, &cube2, &cube3}, tmp_triangulation);

As a result, there is a displacement discontinuity at the beginning of the simulation.
